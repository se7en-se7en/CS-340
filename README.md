Maintaining, reading, and adapting programs are crucial aspects of computer science. In Project One and Two, the CRUD Python module played a key role in achieving these qualities. By separating database operations into a reusable module, code became more maintainable and readable. The module's adaptability allowed for seamless integration with the dashboard widgets in Project Two. The advantages of this approach extend beyond the current projects, as the CRUD Python module can be leveraged in future endeavors, ensuring efficient database interactions and reducing redundancy.

Approaching problems as a computer scientist involves a systematic and analytical mindset. Me, being autistic, can sometimes help in this aspect. In the Grazioso Salvare project, a methodical approach was taken, understanding requirements, designing a database, and refining the solution. Future database projects would follow a similar strategy, breaking down problems and using design principles and optimization techniques.

Computer scientists play a crucial role in helping companies like Grazioso Salvare streamline operations and make data-driven decisions. The maintainable codebase ensures future enhancements, while the database-driven dashboard provides valuable info. This work helps companies to adapt to changing needs and optimize their products, and customer experiences which leads to better business outcomes.
